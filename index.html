        <p>The Federal Republic of Nigeria is a large and diverse country located in West Africa. Often called the
            "Giant of
            Africa," it's the continent's most populous nation, with an estimated population of over 230 million people.
            Nigeria is
            a federation of 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, with its capital city, Abuja, situated in the
            center of the
            country.Nigeria has a varied landscape, with its geography and climate changing from south to north. The
            southern region has a
            tropical rainforest climate, characterized by high rainfall and humidity. As you move northward, the climate
            transitions
            to a tropical savanna with distinct wet and dry seasons. The far north has a semi-arid Sahel climate, which
            is hot and
            dry with a short rainy season. The country is home to the Niger River, the primary river in West Africa,
            which flows
            through the country and forms the vast Niger Delta in the south.Nigeria has a varied landscape, with its
